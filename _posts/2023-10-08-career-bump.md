title: what if working for faang was a huge fucking mistake?

I've been working for one the the FAANGs/MAMAA for several years now. It's been enlightening, but now I wonder if this will actually do more harm than good. While here, I feel like I've grown in the impact and influence dimension, but have lost a lot of depth in tech skills. 

Does having a a role of Solutions Architect/TAM (Customer Engineer/Enterprise Account Engineer)/Customer Success Manager help or hinder the next role? How to measure success of folks who used to be in these roles, but moved out of FAANG/MAMAAA?
