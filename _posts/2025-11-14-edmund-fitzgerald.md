excerpt: "On November 10, 1975, a 729-foot freighter and 29 crew members disappeared into Lake Superior in minutes. The lake doesn't care about your shipping schedule."

The Edmund Fitzgerald was a massive steel freighter. 729 feet long. Built to haul iron ore across the Great Lakes. Named after the president of the company that commissioned her. [1]

And on November 10, 1975, Lake Superior swallowed it whole.

All 29 crew members died. No one survived to tell exactly what happened. The ship just... vanished into the water in minutes, in the middle of a massive storm.

**The lake doesn't care:**

People treat the Great Lakes like they're friendly neighborhood ponds. Like they're less dangerous than the ocean because they're "just lakes."

Lake Superior is 350 miles long, 160 miles wide, and over 1,300 feet deep in places. [2]

It contains 10% of the world's surface fresh water. It's so big it has its own weather systems. It's so cold that bodies don't decompose - they just stay down there, preserved in the near-freezing water. [3]

The Edmund Fitzgerald wasn't some tiny fishing boat. It was a MASSIVE FREIGHTER. One of the largest ships on the Great Lakes at the time. Built to withstand storms.

And Lake Superior took it down in minutes.

**What probably happened:**

No one knows for sure, but here's what we think: [4]

The Fitzgerald was loaded with 26,000 tons of iron ore pellets. It was November, which is a terrible time to be on Lake Superior because the storms are brutal. A massive storm system was moving through, with waves over 25 feet high and winds up to 86 mph.

The ship started taking on water. The captain reported that the ship had "a fence rail down, two vents lost or damaged, and a list." Translation: things were already going wrong.

Then the radar went out. They were navigating by staying close to another ship, the Arthur M. Anderson, which was following behind them.

The last message from the Fitzgerald's captain was: "We are holding our own."

Ten minutes later, the Anderson's captain tried to reach them. Nothing. The ship had vanished from radar. Just... gone.

It had broken in two and sunk, taking all 29 crew members with it. No distress call. No time to abandon ship. Just gone.

**The recovery:**

They found the wreck in 530 feet of water, broken in two pieces. [5]

The bow section was right-side up. The stern was upside down. They were about 170 feet apart.

No bodies were recovered. They're still down there. The families asked that the wreck be left undisturbed as a grave site.

Which is the right call, but also HAUNTING. There's a massive steel ship at the bottom of Lake Superior with 29 people still inside it.

**The lesson:**

Nature doesn't care about your engineering. It doesn't care that your ship is massive and steel and supposedly unsinkable. It doesn't care about your schedule or your cargo or your plans.

Lake Superior is a cold, deep, merciless body of water that has killed thousands of people over the years. [6]

The Edmund Fitzgerald was just one more.

We build bigger ships. Better weather forecasting. Improved safety regulations. All because we want to pretend we've conquered the water.

But we haven't. And the lake knows it.

**Why this matters:**

29 people went to work on November 10, 1975. They were doing their jobs. Hauling cargo across the lake like they'd done dozens of times before.

And they never came home.

Their families never got closure. Never got to bury them. The lake kept them.

The Fitzgerald went down 50 years ago this month. The crew is still down there. The lake never gave them back.

Remember them.
