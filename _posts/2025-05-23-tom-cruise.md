title: a waking dream
---


I occasionally have these awake dreams, or visions, or things that cross through my mind.

This time I had the vision of Will Ferrell (6' 3") walking around in "middle aged Dad" attire with a baby-bjorn. 

Riding in the baby-bjorn is Tom Cruise (4' 11") and Tom Cruise is randomly yelling quotes from his movies at people on the street. 

While little Tom Cruise is fidgeting and yelling "I FEEL THE NEED FOR SPEED!" and "YOU COMPLETE ME!" to strangers, Will is acting as a patient dad, trying to calm his little tyke. Little Tom Cruise is yelling at passers by " YOU HAD ME AT HELLO! " and " I WANT THE TRUTH!" 

People are just smiling awkwardly, showing great empathy to Will-the-father, probably because most of them have had the experience of a toddler meltdown in the fabric softener aisle. "EVERYBODY RUNS, FLETCH!"

While Will is apologizing for the "SHOW ME THE MONEY!" ruckus of his little guy..... "HELP ME, HELP YOU!"


It'll get better daddy Will. You're doing great!

...

anyway happy father's day.
