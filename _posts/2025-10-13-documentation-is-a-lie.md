title: documentation is a lie we tell ourselves

You know what's hilarious? We all agree documentation is important. We nod sagely in meetings about it. We add it to sprint planning. We create entire tickets for it.

And then we don't fucking do it.

Here's the thing: documentation isn't actually about writing. It's about admitting that the brilliant mental model you have of your system isn't telepathically transmitted to your teammates. It's about humility. And developers are not great at humility.

**The documentation paradox:**

When you write code, you understand it perfectly. Your mental model is pristine. Documentation feels redundant, like explaining a joke you just told.

Two months later, you're staring at your own code like it's written in ancient Sumerian. You curse past-you for not leaving breadcrumbs. The cycle repeats.

**Why we actually don't document:**

It's not laziness. It's that documentation has no dopamine hit. Shipping features gives you that sweet, sweet endorphin rush. Fixing bugs feels like victory. Documentation feels like homework.

Plus, documentation becomes outdated the moment you commit it. You refactor something, and now your beautiful README is a liar. So why bother? [1]

**The uncomfortable truth:**

Code is not self-documenting. I don't care how clean your functions are or how semantic your variable names. Code tells you *what* and *how*. It doesn't tell you *why*, and it sure as hell doesn't tell you *why not*.

That architectural decision to use a message queue instead of direct API calls? The comment explaining it takes 30 seconds to write. The six hours your teammate will spend debugging a "simplification" that breaks the async pattern? That's your documentation debt collecting interest.

**What actually works:**

Inline comments for the weird stuff. Not "this increments the counter" useless comments. The "we tried X but it fails under Y condition so we're doing Z" comments.

Architecture Decision Records for the big stuff. One markdown file per major decision. It's not about creating a novel, it's about leaving a trail.

Update the README when you onboard someone. Watch what they ask. Those questions are your documentation gaps screaming at you.

**The reality:**

Documentation is insurance. It feels expensive until you need it. The difference is, with documentation, you *always* eventually need it.

Future-you will thank present-you. Or present-you will curse past-you.

Your choice.
