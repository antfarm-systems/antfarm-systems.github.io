title: GenAI code review

I asked Amazon Q (Claude Sonnet 4.5) to do a deep dive review of the code that powers this website.

Among the recommendations:

```
### **Immediate Fixes Needed**

1. Fix broken post links in index.html
2. Remove profanity from professional-facing content
3. Consolidate Google Analytics implementation
4. Add proper meta descriptions to posts.

```

I think it's fine to be a bit profane these days, Claude. It's fine.
