excerpt: Tech workers think they're different from the working class. They're not. You're closer to your first billion than Elon is. Know what team you're on.

Tech workers have this delusion that they're not *really* workers. They're "knowledge workers." They're "innovators." They're building the future.

No. You're labor. Just like everyone else who trades time and skill for money.

And the sooner you figure that out, the better off you'll be.

**The RTO scam:**

Return to office mandates are not about productivity. Study after study shows remote work is fine, sometimes better. [1]

RTO is about:
- Commercial real estate investments that need to justify their existence
- Middle managers who measure productivity by butts in seats
- A soft layoff strategy (make it miserable, people quit, no severance needed)

You know who doesn't have RTO mandates? The executives pushing them. They're on their third Zoom call this week from their vacation home.

When they say "collaboration" and "culture," what they mean is "control." They want to see you. They want you tired from the commute. They want you too exhausted to interview elsewhere.

**Work-life balance is a lie:**

Not because balance is impossible. Because the framing is fucked.

"Work-life balance" implies work and life are separate but equal things you juggle.

They're not equal. One is your life. The other is how you pay for your life. Treating them as equivalent is the con.

The phrase itself is corporate propaganda. It puts the burden on YOU to balance. Not on the company to respect your time. Not on the system to provide living wages for reasonable hours. On you.

"Sarah doesn't have good work-life balance" means "Sarah works too much." But we phrase it like it's her fault, not the company's for demanding it.

**The class consciousness gap:**

Here's the thing tech workers don't want to hear: You are not management. You are not an owner. You do not have real equity (RSUs that vest over 4 years while you can be fired any Tuesday are not ownership). [2]

You are working class.

Yes, even at $200k. Yes, even with the ping pong table. Yes, even with the fancy title.

If you have to work to survive, you're working class. If someone else owns the company and you don't, you're working class. If you can be fired and your healthcare disappears, you're working class.

**The billionaire gap you don't understand:**

You're closer to your first billion than Elon is to his next hundred billion.

Let me make that concrete: you will NEVER be a billionaire. Neither will he run out of money.

**Know what team you're on:**

The person making $15/hour at Starbucks? That's your team. The plumber, the electrician, the nurse, the teacher? Your team.

The billionaire CEO telling you that unions are bad and you should be grateful for your ping pong table? Not your team. Never was. Never will be.

They will fire you to juice quarterly earnings. They will cut your health insurance to save money. They will automate your job the second it's profitable and tell you it's "innovation."

The factory worker whose job got outsourced in the 90s? You have more in common with them than you do with your CEO. Their industry got disrupted too. They got told to "learn to code." Now AI is coming for your code. See the pattern?

**What this means:**

Unionize. Seriously. Tech unions work. Look at the game industry starting to organize. Look at Google and Amazon workers coordinating. [3]

Stop identifying with your company. You are not a "Googler" or an "Amazonian." You are a software engineer who currently works at Google. The distinction matters.

Support other workers. When the warehouse workers are striking, you don't cross that line. When customer service is fighting for better conditions, you back them. Because their fight is your fight.

Vote like you're working class. Because you are. Policies that help nurses and teachers and electricians? Those help you too. You're all one bad quarter away from being fired.

**The reality:**

You got lucky. Right place, right time, right skills during a tech boom. That's great. Take the money. Build your safety net.

But don't confuse luck with superiority. Don't confuse a good salary with being on the owner's side of the equation.

You're labor. Own it. Organize around it. Vote for it.

Because the billionaires? They already know what team they're on. And they're playing to win.
