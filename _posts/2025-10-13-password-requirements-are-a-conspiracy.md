title: password requirements are a psychological experiment

Your password must contain:
- At least 12 characters
- One uppercase letter
- One lowercase letter
- One number
- One special character
- But not THOSE special characters
- The tears of a unicorn
- A reference to a movie from 1987

And you can't reuse any of your last 47 passwords. Also, you need to change it every 60 days.

**This is how you create the password "Summer2024!"**

Every. Single. Time.

**The security theater:**

Password requirements don't make passwords more secure. They make them more predictable.

"Requires one capital letter" means 90% of people capitalize the first letter. "Requires one number" means people slap a "1" at the end or use their birth year. "Requires special character" and suddenly everyone's password ends with "!" [1]

The rules designed to prevent predictable passwords are CREATING predictable passwords. It's like fighting fire with gasoline.

**The complexity paradox:**

Here's what actually happens with complex password requirements:

You create a password you'll never remember. You write it on a sticky note under your keyboard. Congratulations, your "secure" password is now less secure than "password123" would have been.

Or you use a password manager. Which is great! Until that password manager gets breached and now all your eggs are in one very hacked basket. [2]

**The rotation nightmare:**

"Change your password every 90 days for security."

Why? What threat model does this address? If someone has your password, they're using it NOW. Not waiting politely for 91 days.

All this does is encourage people to use variations of the same password. "Summer2024!" becomes "Fall2024!" becomes "Winter2024!" You're not more secure, you're just tracking seasons.

**What actually works:**

Long passphrases. "correct horse battery staple" is more secure than "P@ssw0rd!" and infinitely easier to remember. [3]

But no. We can't have nice things. Because some security consultant in 1987 decided complexity beats length and now we're all stuck with it.

Two-factor authentication. This actually helps. But it's also annoying, which means adoption is low.

Password managers. Yes, even with the breach risk. Because the alternative is worse.

**The real problem:**

We've built a security model that assumes users are the weak point. So we punish them with increasingly baroque requirements that don't actually improve security.

Meanwhile, companies store passwords in plaintext, get breached, and blame users for having "weak" passwords.

The password was "Spring2024!" because YOUR REQUIREMENTS forced it to be "Spring2024!" Maybe the problem isn't the users.

**The future we deserve:**

Passwordless authentication exists. Passkeys exist. Biometrics exist. We have better options.

But we're stuck in this hellscape of uppercase lowercase number special character rotate quarterly dance because changing enterprise systems is hard and admitting the last 30 years of password policy were wrong is harder.

So I'll be over here, updating my password from "Autumn2024!" to "Winter2024!" and pretending this makes sense.

See you in 90 days when I need to change it again.
