Just a note about the outage in aws region us-east-1 the other day. A lot of teams are doing reviews of their Business Continuity Plans, Having [PIR](https://www.google.com/search?q=post+incident+reviews) (RCAs) and looking for gaps in their infrastructure design. If your approach is to ***blame*** the developers, operations, SREs and other people working on your system, 

**YOU ARE DOING IT WRONG.**

While you may think you're being a **"STRONG LEADER"**, and reducing errors and risks, what you are actually doing is telling people not to identify weaknesses, gaps, and risks, making your system less secure and less reliable. You're also buring trust in your people, who can and will leave for workplaces that are far less toxic.


This week you should be celebrating the gaps you found on December 7. Get those gaps prioritized and thank your staff. #hugops
