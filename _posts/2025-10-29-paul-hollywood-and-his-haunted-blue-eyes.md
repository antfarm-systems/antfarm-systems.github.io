The Great British Bake Off is proof that we don't deserve nice things, and also that sometimes we get them anyway.

Season 9 (2018) was peak GBBO. Kim-Joy made everything into an adorable animal. Rahul had a panic attack every episode and somehow won. Ruby was 18 and better at baking than you'll ever be at anything. And through it all, Paul Hollywood stared at their creations with those unsettling blue eyes like he was trying to see into their souls. [1]

Spoiler alert: He saw nothing. Paul Hollywood has the emotional range of a soggy bottom.

**The contestants were perfect and we didn't deserve them:**

Kim-Joy made bread hedgehogs. BREAD. HEDGEHOGS. She put little faces on everything. Her bakes looked like they belonged in a Studio Ghibli film. [2]

And Paul was like "The crumb structure is slightly uneven."

MY GUY. IT'S A HEDGEHOG. MADE OF BREAD. WITH A LITTLE FACE. READ THE ROOM.

Kim-Joy was too pure for this world. Every episode she wore a different adorable outfit covered in cats or mushrooms, created bakes that looked like woodland creatures, and smiled through Paul's criticism like she was accepting her fate.

She didn't win, but she won our hearts. And honestly, that's worth more than Paul Hollywood's handshake. Which brings me to:

**The Paul Hollywood handshake:**

Paul acts like his handshake is a Michelin star. Like getting a handshake from him will change your life. Like you'll go home and tell your grandchildren "In 2018, Paul Hollywood shook my hand because my puff pastry was adequately laminated."

It's a handshake. From a man whose primary achievement is being British and good at bread. [3]

He gives it out like he's bestowing knighthood. Meanwhile Prue is giving actual feedback and constructive criticism like a normal judge, and Paul is over there brooding because someone's bake is "a bit dry."

The handshake is not an honor. It's a participation trophy for adults who are too old to cry when they don't get one.

**Rahul's anxiety was all of us:**

Rahul spent the entire season having a full mental breakdown and somehow won. [4]

He'd pull something out of the oven that looked perfect, and immediately go "Oh no. This is terrible. I've failed. What have I done."

And Noel or Sandi would be like "Rahul, mate, that looks incredible."

And Rahul would respond "No, no. It's ruined. I'm going home. This is it. I've disgraced my family."

Then Paul and Prue would taste it and be like "That's amazing actually."

And Rahul would seem SURPRISED. Every time. As if he hadn't just created a structural engineering masterpiece out of sugar and spite.

Rahul won the whole thing and still seemed shocked that anyone liked his bakes. Relatable king.

**Prue Leith is a treasure:**

Prue replaced Mary Berry, which was an impossible task, and somehow made it work by being herself instead of trying to be Mary.

She wore colorful glasses. She gave useful feedback. She actually seemed excited about the bakes. She didn't pretend that being a judge on a baking show was a solemn duty that required her to emotionally devastate amateur bakers.

Unlike some people. (Paul.)

Prue would say things like "The flavor is wonderful, but the texture is a bit off" like a normal person. Paul would say "The bake is underdone" like he was pronouncing a death sentence.

Prue understood the assignment: this is a show about amateur bakers trying their best at increasingly ridiculous challenges. It should be encouraging and delightful.

Paul did not get that memo. Paul thinks he's judging the World Bread Championships.

**Paul Hollywood's whole thing:**

Let's talk about Paul. [5]

Paul Hollywood looks like someone tried to draw Gordon Ramsay from memory. He has the permanent expression of a man who's just bitten into a scone and found it slightly underbaked.

His signature move is staring intensely at a bake, breaking it open, staring some more, and then saying something devastating like "It's not quite there, is it?"

PAUL. THEY HAD TWO HOURS TO MAKE CROISSANTS FROM SCRATCH. IN A TENT. IN THE BRITISH SUMMER HEAT. WHILE BEING FILMED.

Maybe cut them some slack?

But no. Paul needs everyone to know that he has STANDARDS. He's SERIOUS about BAKING. This is not a GAME.

Except it literally is a game. It's a reality competition show. Calm down.

**The Paul Hollywood ego:**

Paul named his book "How to Bake." Not "How Paul Hollywood Bakes" or "Baking with Paul." Just "How to Bake." As if he invented baking. As if before Paul Hollywood, people just threw flour at walls and hoped for bread. [6]

He acts like bread is a personality trait. Like being good at sourdough makes you a better person.

Paul. You're a baker from the Wirral. You're very good at your job. That's great. But maybe stop acting like you're the Dalai Lama of dough.

**The affair:**

We need to talk about it. In 2017, Paul Hollywood left his wife for his much younger co-star from the American Baking Competition. [7]

Then acted like nothing happened.

Then came back to GBBO and continued judging people's bakes with the moral authority of someone who didn't blow up their 20-year marriage for a brief affair.

The audacity. The sheer audacity to stand there, stare at someone's imperfect Victoria sponge, and go "That's disappointing" when YOU, sir, are the disappointment.

Kim-Joy's bread hedgehog never cheated on anyone. Just saying.

**Why we watch anyway:**

Here's the thing: GBBO is perfect despite Paul Hollywood, not because of him.

We watch because Rahul has an existential crisis over doughnuts. Because Kim-Joy makes everything adorable. Because Ruby is 18 and already more talented than most professionals. Because Briony is a full-time parent who still finds time to nail a Charlotte Russe.

We watch because it's a show where the biggest drama is whether someone's caramel sets in time. Where contestants help each other. Where failing just means you tried something hard and it didn't work out.

It's the anti-reality show. No one's screaming. No one's sabotaging each other. The hosts make dad jokes and the judges (well, Prue) give constructive feedback.

It's wholesome. It's delightful. It's proof that people can compete without being cruel.

**What GBBO gets right:**

American reality TV has convinced us that competition requires cruelty. That to make good TV, someone needs to cry or have a villain edit or dramatically quit.

GBBO said "What if we just... didn't do that?"

What if we made a show where people are kind to each other? Where failing a technical challenge doesn't mean you're a terrible person? Where the biggest controversy is whether Paul's criticism was fair?

Turns out, that's better. That's the show everyone wants to watch.

Even when Paul's there, glowering at imperfect pastry like it personally offended him.

**The uncomfortable truth:**

Paul Hollywood is the human equivalent of a soggy bottom: technically a problem, but not enough to ruin the whole thing.

He's frustrating, sure. His ego is absurd. His handshake means nothing. His affair was messy and disappointing.

But he also knows bread. He gives (occasionally) useful feedback. And his presence makes Prue's kindness stand out even more.

He's the antagonist GBBO needs but doesn't deserve. The grumpy foil to everyone else's wholesomeness.

**Season 9 was perfect:**

Kim-Joy made bread animals and wore cat sweaters. Rahul anxiety-baked his way to victory. Ruby was a teenage prodigy. Briony proved you can be a parent and still be incredible at everything.

Prue was delightful. Noel and Sandi were chaotic and lovely. The challenges were ridiculous (bread week is always chaos). The bakes were mostly wonderful.

And Paul Hollywood was there, blue eyes haunting the tent like a disappointed ghost who's really good at lamination.

It was perfect.

**What you should actually do:**

Watch GBBO Season 9. Watch Kim-Joy make a bread lion. Watch Rahul spiral over literally everything. Watch Ruby casually nail a showstopper like it's nothing. Watch Prue be kind and Paul be... Paul.

Watch it and remember that not everything has to be cutthroat. That competition can be wholesome. That people can be talented and kind at the same time.

And when Paul Hollywood gives someone a withering look because their bake is "slightly underdone," remember:

That man had an affair and wrote a book called "How to Bake" like he invented flour. His judgment is questionable at best.

The bread hedgehog was perfect and Kim-Joy deserved better.
