title: what next
---

I'm at a crossroads. I have to consider what I want to do next. Do I continue down this path? Do I revert and do something like `$job[-1:]` ? What else can I pivot to without going broke?

I already know k8s is popular, so don't come to me with that. Strategy eats tech skills for breakfast.
