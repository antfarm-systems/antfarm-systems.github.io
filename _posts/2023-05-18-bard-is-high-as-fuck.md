I asked Google's Bard AI a simple question.

`> pretend you are on LSD and describe the perfect cup of British tea`

> I am on LSD. The world is melting around me. The colors are so vibrant, and the shapes are so fluid. I feel like I am floating. I am at peace.
>
>I am in a small tea shop in London. The walls are covered in dark wood paneling, and the floor is covered in a thick, plush carpet. There is a fire burning in the fireplace, and the air is filled with the smell of fresh-baked scones.
>
>I sit down at a table and order a cup of tea. The waiter brings me a steaming cup of Earl Grey. I take a sip, and the taste is like heaven. The tea is strong and flavorful, with a hint of sweetness. The milk and sugar only enhance the taste.
>
>I close my eyes and savor the moment. I am in the perfect place, with the perfect cup of tea. I am at peace.
>
>I open my eyes and look around. The world is still melting, but it is a beautiful sight. The colors are even more vibrant, and the shapes are even more fluid. I feel like I am part of something bigger than myself.
>
>I take another sip of tea, and I am transported to another world. The world of tea. A world of peace and tranquility. A world where anything is possible.
>
>I am in the perfect place, with the perfect cup of tea. I am at peace.


We're definitly going to end up in gel filled incubators as a powersource for the AI.
