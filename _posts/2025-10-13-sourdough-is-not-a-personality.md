Listen. I'm thrilled you discovered bread. Truly. Humanity figured this out around 10,000 BC, but better late than never.

But naming your starter? Posting daily updates about "Gertrude's" bubble activity? Creating an Instagram account for your fucking *yeast*?

We need to talk.

**The sourdough industrial complex:**

Somewhere along the line, making bread became a competitive sport. It's not enough to bake anymore. You need:

A starter with a backstory. Bonus points if it's "descended from a 150-year-old culture from a monastery in the Pyrenees." It's yeast. It eats flour and farts gas. The provenance doesn't matter. [1]

A Dutch oven that costs more than your first car. Yes, you can bake sourdough in a regular pot. No, the $400 Le Creuset doesn't make your bread taste like you have your shit together.

A scoring knife that looks like it belongs in a museum. A razor blade works fine. Your bread doesn't know the difference.

A feeding schedule more rigid than your medication. "I feed my starter at 6am and 6pm every day." Cool. It's yeast, not a tamagotchi. It can wait.

**The recipe rabbit hole:**

Recipe blogs are their own special hell. You want to know the hydration ratio for ciabatta. Instead, you get a 4,000-word memoir about someone's trip to Tuscany and their grandmother's third husband's philosophy on olive oil.

Just tell me how much water to flour, Karen. I don't need the hero's journey.

And the gatekeeping. Oh, the gatekeeping. "That's not *real* sourdough, you added commercial yeast." Fuck off. If it tastes good and I made it, it's real enough.

**The performative aspect:**

Instagram has convinced an entire generation that food only exists to be photographed at a 45-degree angle with "natural" lighting that required three ring lights to achieve.

Your bread doesn't need to look like it belongs in a Parisian bakery window. Ugly bread tastes the same as pretty bread. Sometimes better, because you spent time on flavor instead of making sure your scoring pattern looks like a fucking wheat stalk.

**What baking actually is:**

Mixing flour and water and heat. That's it. Everything else is optional.

The irony is that the best bakers aren't on social media documenting every fold. They're too busy baking. Making mistakes. Burning shit. Trying again.

Sourdough isn't meditation. It's not self-care. It's not a spiritual journey.

It's bread.

Delicious, carb-loaded, makes-your-house-smell-amazing bread. That's enough. That's always been enough.

So yes, make your bread. Feed your starter. Get flour absolutely everywhere because that's unavoidable. But maybe we can all agree that bread doesn't need a LinkedIn profile.

Unless it's applying for jobs. Then it's a great way to get recruiter spam and we can all laugh.

Actually, no. Don't do that either.
