title: the million/billion confusion that keeps you voting wrong

excerpt: You think "tax the rich" means you. It doesn't. Your brain's inability to distinguish millions from billions is why you're voting against your own interests.

Here's how billionaires stay billionaires: they convince you that you're on the same team.

And it works because your brain can't tell the difference between a million and a billion.

**The confusion:**

Poll: "Should we raise taxes on people making over $400,000/year?"

Person making $60,000/year: "That's not fair. People who work hard shouldn't be punished."

Cool. Let's talk about who you're defending.

**You are not almost rich:**

If you make $60k/year, someone making $400k/year makes 6.6x what you make.

Sounds like a lot, right? "The rich."

Now let's talk about billionaires.

Someone worth $1 billion has 1,667x more money than someone making $60k/year (assuming they saved every penny for 10 years).

Someone worth $100 billion? That's 166,667x more money.

When you say "don't tax the rich," you think you're protecting the person making $400k. You're actually protecting the person worth $100 billion who paid for the ads that convinced you that you and the $400k person are the same.

You're not.

**The "temporarily embarrassed millionaire" problem:**

Americans don't think of themselves as poor. They think of themselves as "pre-rich." [1]

"I'm not against taxing billionaires because I'm a billionaire. I'm against it because someday I might be a billionaire."

No, you won't.

The odds of becoming a billionaire in the US are roughly 1 in 578,000. You're more likely to be struck by lightning. Twice. In the same year. [2]

But you vote like you're going to win the lottery. And billionaires count on that.

**The policy confusion:**

"Estate tax is theft! The government taking your money when you die!"

The estate tax only applies to estates over $13.61 million (2024). If your estate is worth less than that, you pay $0. [3]

If you're making $60k/year, you're not accumulating a $13 million estate. You're defending a tax that will never apply to you.

"Capital gains taxes punish investors!"

Most Americans don't have capital gains. They have a 401k (taxed as income) or nothing.

Capital gains are how billionaires make money. Zuckerberg doesn't get a W2. He gets stock. When he sells it, that's capital gains. Taxed at 20% (lower than your income tax rate). [4]

When you fight against capital gains taxes, you're fighting for Mark Zuckerberg to pay a lower rate than you.

**The language trick:**

Billionaires pay millions to confuse you about language.

"Small business owners" - They mean people making $400k+/year. Your local coffee shop? Not who they're talking about.

"Job creators" - They mean billionaires. As if Elon Musk personally creates jobs instead of workers creating value that Elon captures (and then fires them via tweet).

"Taxing success" - They mean taxing extreme wealth accumulation. Making $60k is success. Making $400k is success. Having $100 billion is not "success," it's a policy failure.

**The actual math:**

Proposed wealth tax: 2% on wealth over $50 million. [5]

Does this affect you if you make $60k/year? No.
Does this affect you if you make $400k/year? No.
Does this affect you if you're worth $10 million? No.

It affects 700 people in the entire United States. Out of 335 million.

And they spend hundreds of millions convincing you to vote against it.

**The healthcare version:**

"Medicare for All will raise your taxes!"

Yeah, by $2,000/year. And eliminate your $8,000/year insurance premium. Net gain: $6,000/year. [6]

But the insurance companies spent $600 million convincing you that "higher taxes" is scary. They rely on you not doing math.

**The education version:**

"Student loan forgiveness is unfair to people who paid off their loans!"

Also unfair to people who never got polio because we eradicated polio. Should we bring polio back for fairness?

Student loan forgiveness costs $400 billion. PPP loan forgiveness (mostly to businesses) cost $800 billion. Nobody asked if that was fair. [7]

The difference? PPP loans went to business owners. Student loans went to workers. Which one do you think billionaires want you mad about?

Peter Thiel famously said democracy and freedom are incompatible because voters might vote to tax him. [8] He's not hiding whose side he's on. Why are you?

**The actual divide:**

The policy fight isn't between people making $60k and people making $400k.

It's between people who work for money and people whose money works for them.

If you have to show up to a job to survive, you're on the same side as everyone else who has to show up to a job. Whether that job pays $15/hour or $200/hour.

The enemy is not the person making more than you. The enemy is the person who makes nothing and owns everything.

**How to fix your brain:**

Every time you hear "tax the rich," ask: "Rich like my doctor neighbor? Or rich like the guy who owns 12 houses and a yacht?"

Every time you hear "small business," ask: "Small like a coffee shop or small like a $50M/year law firm?"

Every time you hear "job creators," ask: "Creating jobs or extracting value from workers who create value?"

The words are designed to confuse you. Stop letting them.

**Vote like you make what you make:**

If you make $60k, vote for policies that help people making $60k.

If you make $400k, you're doing fine. You don't need protection from taxes.

If you're worth $1 billion, I don't know why you're reading this blog, but you should absolutely pay more in taxes.

Know what team you're on. Because billionaires sure as hell know what team they're on.
