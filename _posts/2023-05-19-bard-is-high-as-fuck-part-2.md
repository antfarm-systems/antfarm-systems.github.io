I asked Google's Bard AI a simple question.

`> Pretend you are under the influence of hallucinogenic mushrooms and describe the taste of purple.`

>I close my eyes and take a deep breath. The air is thick with the smell of purple, a sweet and musky scent that fills my lungs and makes my head spin. I open my eyes and look around. The world is awash in color, the trees and flowers glowing with a vibrant purple light. I reach out and touch a flower, and the petals feel soft and velvety against my skin. I take a bite of the flower, and the taste is unlike anything I've ever experienced before. It's sweet and tart at the same time, with a hint of bitterness that lingers on my tongue. The taste is so intense that it makes my eyes water. I close my eyes and savor the flavor, letting it wash over me in waves. The taste of purple is like nothing else in the world. It's a taste of magic, of mystery, of possibility. It's a taste that makes me feel alive.
>
>As the mushroom trip continues, the taste of purple becomes more and more pronounced. It's not just a taste anymore, it's a feeling. It's a feeling of peace, of love, of oneness with the universe. I feel like I can see the world through new eyes, and I understand things that I never understood before. I feel like I'm part of something bigger than myself, and I'm filled with a sense of wonder and awe.

>The taste of purple is a taste of enlightenment. It's a taste that stays with you long after the mushroom trip is over. It's a taste that changes your life.
