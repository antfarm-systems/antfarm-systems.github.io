excerpt: If you have to post about waking up at 4am to work on your side hustle, you're not inspiring anyone. You're just tired and need therapy.

LinkedIn has become a support group for people who think sleep is for the weak and work-life balance is a conspiracy by lazy people.

And the posts. Oh god, the posts.

**The 4am wakeup hero:**

"I wake up at 4am every day to work on my side hustle before my 9-5. No excuses. If you want success, you sacrifice sleep."

Cool story. You know what successful people actually do? They sleep. Bezos sleeps 8 hours. [1] Gates sleeps 7. [2] The "no sleep" flex is not a flex. It's a cry for help disguised as productivity porn.

You're not grinding. You're burning out and calling it ambition.

**The humble brag:**

"Three years ago I was fired from my $200k job. Today I just closed a $10M Series A for my startup. Never give up on your dreams! 🙏"

Conspicuously missing: The trust fund. The spouse's income. The connections from your Ivy League MBA. The fact that "never give up" really means "have enough money to not work for three years while you build your startup."

Survivorship bias is not a business strategy. For every one of you, there are 10,000 people who tried the same thing and are now working retail to pay off debt.

**The fake vulnerability:**

"I'm going to be vulnerable here. Last year I struggled with burnout while scaling my company to $50M ARR. But I learned that asking for help is a strength! 💪"

Vulnerability is not listing your accomplishments while pretending to be relatable. That's a humble brag wearing a vulnerability costume.

Real vulnerability: "I'm burning out and I don't know how to stop. I'm afraid if I slow down I'll be irrelevant."

But that doesn't get engagement, does it?

**The inspiration porn:**

"A janitor asked me what I do for a living. I told him I'm a CEO. He said 'I'm just a janitor.' I told him 'JUST? You keep this building running!' We both cried. Everyone clapped. Remember: EVERY job matters! ❤️"

This didn't happen. And if it did happen, you're a sociopath for posting it for clout.

You don't respect janitors. If you did, you'd pay them more. You're using someone else's job as a prop for your inspirational content calendar.

**The grindset mentality:**

"While you're sleeping, I'm working. While you're watching Netflix, I'm building my empire. While you're complaining about being tired, I'm hustling. That's the difference between winners and everyone else."

The difference between you and everyone else is that everyone else has developed a personality outside of work. You've turned capitalism into your entire identity.

You're not a winner. You're a cautionary tale waiting to happen.

**The corporate bootlicker:**

"My CEO called me at 11pm on a Friday to discuss a project. I was honored that he thought of me! This is what it takes to succeed at a high-growth startup! 💼"

No. Your CEO has terrible boundaries and you have Stockholm syndrome.

Being available 24/7 is not loyalty. It's exploitation that you've rebranded as opportunity. [3]

**The thought leader:**

"After 10 years in tech, I've learned that success isn't about working harder. It's about working smarter. Here are my 7 tips for optimizing your productivity (thread):"

Your tips are: wake up early, exercise, meditate, journal, time-block, say no to meetings, and have a morning routine.

Congratulations. You've discovered what every productivity book from 1998 already said. You're not a thought leader. You're a thought repeater.

**The uncomfortable truth:**

Hustle culture is not about success. It's about making peace with the fact that wages haven't kept up with cost of living for 40 years. [4]

You don't have a side hustle because you're ambitious. You have a side hustle because your main hustle doesn't pay enough to buy a house in the city where you work.

But admitting that is depressing. Saying "I'm grinding because I love the hustle" is way better than saying "I'm grinding because I'm one medical emergency away from bankruptcy."

**The actual scam:**

The people selling you hustle culture are not grinding. They're monetizing your insecurity.

They wake up at 4am to film a video about waking up at 4am. That's their job. Their side hustle is selling you courses on how to build a side hustle. It's a pyramid scheme with better branding. [5]

Gary Vee is not grinding. He's selling you the idea that you should grind while he makes money on book deals and speaking fees. That's the hustle. You're the mark.

**What success actually looks like:**

Sleeping enough. Having hobbies that aren't monetized. Spending time with people you like. Doing work that pays well enough that you don't need a side hustle to survive.

Not posting about any of it on LinkedIn because you're too busy living your actual life.

**The reality:**

If you're actually successful, you don't need to post about it. Bezos is not on LinkedIn talking about his morning routine. Neither is anyone else who's actually made it.

LinkedIn humble brags are the participation trophy of the professional world. You're not inspiring anyone. You're making everyone else feel inadequate while you fish for validation from strangers.

**What you should actually do:**

Log off. Seriously. Delete LinkedIn from your phone. Stop comparing your behind-the-scenes to everyone else's highlight reel.

Work reasonable hours at a job that pays you fairly. If that job doesn't exist, unionize or quit. Don't romanticize the grind.

Sleep. Exercise because it feels good, not because some guy on LinkedIn told you winners wake up at 4am.

Build a life that doesn't require you to perform productivity for an audience of people you don't know.

The hustle will not set you free. It will just make you tired.

**The meta part:**

This post will get zero engagement on LinkedIn because LinkedIn rewards the exact behavior I'm criticizing.

That's fine. This blog is not a growth strategy. It's a reminder that you don't have to optimize everything, including your existence, for someone else's profit.

You're allowed to just... exist. Without hustling. Without grinding. Without proving your worth to strangers on the internet.

Radical idea, I know.
