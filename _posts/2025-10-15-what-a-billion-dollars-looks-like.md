excerpt: Your brain can't process the difference between a million and a billion. Here's why that matters and what billionaires are actually worth in terms you can understand.

Your brain is lying to you about how much money a billion dollars is.

A million and a billion both feel like "more money than I'll ever have," so your brain treats them the same. They're not the same. They're not even close.

Let me make this concrete.

**Time:**

A million seconds ago was 11 days ago. You were doing whatever you were doing last week.

A billion seconds ago was August 1993. Bill Clinton was president. Jurassic Park was in theaters. The internet was something nerds used. You probably weren't born yet, or you were a kid.

A trillion seconds ago was 29,700 BC. Humans were still figuring out fire. Mammoths walked the earth.

**Distance:**

A million dollars in $100 bills fits in a standard school backpack. It weighs 22 pounds. You could carry it. [1]

A billion dollars in $100 bills is a pallet 5 feet tall. It weighs 10 tons. You need a forklift.

Elon Musk is worth about $250 billion. That's 250 of those pallets. That's 2,500 tons of hundred-dollar bills. You'd need a warehouse the size of a Costco.

**Spending:**

If you spent $1,000 every single day, it would take you 2.7 years to spend a million dollars.

At that same rate, it would take you 2,740 YEARS to spend a billion dollars. You'd need to have started in 716 BC. Before the Roman Republic. Before the Buddha. Before written Greek history.

Elon Musk could spend $1 million every day and it would take him 685 years to run out of money.

**Earning:**

At $50,000/year (roughly median US income), saving 100% with no taxes or expenses, it takes 20 years to earn a million dollars.

At that rate, it takes 20,000 years to earn a billion dollars. You'd need to have started in 18,000 BC, during the last Ice Age, when humans were still nomadic hunter-gatherers.

At $200,000/year (top 10% of US earners), saving 100% with no taxes, it still takes 5,000 years to earn a billion. You'd need to have started before the invention of writing.

**The visceral version:**

A million is a nice house in a good neighborhood. Life-changing money if you're broke. Comfortable retirement if you're not.

A billion is "I bought a yacht so big I need a second yacht to carry my cars." [2]

A billion is "I'm going to space for fun because I'm bored" (Bezos).

A billion is "I'm going to buy Twitter for $44 billion and run it into the ground for the lulz" (Elon).

A billion is "I spent $40 billion on the metaverse and all I got was legless avatars" (Zuckerberg).

A hundred billion is "I could give every American $300 and still be a billionaire" (which several of them could do).

**Why billionaires want you confused:**

If people actually understood the difference, they'd be furious.

When someone says "we should tax billionaires more," and someone making $80k says "that's not fair, they earned it," that person doesn't understand scale.

Nobody earns a billion dollars. You can't. There aren't enough hours in a lifetime. If you made $5,000 an hour, working 24/7 with no sleep, it would take you 23 years to earn a billion dollars.

Mark Zuckerberg made more than that yesterday from his Meta stock. While posting AI-generated images of himself looking cool.

**The policy implications:**

When politicians argue about raising taxes on people making $400k+ and someone making $60k says "that's unfair to tax the rich more," they're confused about who "the rich" are.

Someone making $400k is doing well. Someone worth $400 billion is 1 MILLION times wealthier.

A 5% wealth tax on billionaires wouldn't make them less rich. It would just make them slightly less obscenely rich.

If you took 99% of Elon Musk's wealth, he'd still have $2.5 billion. He'd still be richer than you could become in 1,000 lifetimes.

**The bottom line:**

A billion dollars is not "a lot of money." It's an obscene amount of money. It's more money than any human could spend in a lifetime while living absurdly well.

And we have people with 200+ billion dollars while teachers are buying their own classroom supplies and GoFundMe is the largest healthcare provider in America.

The scale matters. Understanding it changes how you think about taxes, about labor, about who deserves what.

Your brain wants to group "million" and "billion" together because they're both abstract big numbers.

Don't let it. The difference is the entire political battlefield.
