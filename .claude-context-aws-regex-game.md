# AWS Regex Roulette Game - Project Context

## What We're Building
**Regex Roulette: AWS Edition** - An interactive browser game for the antfarm.systems blog, similar to the existing Hangman game.

## Game Concept
- **AWS Service Memory Match** style game with regex challenges
- Players see AWS service icons and must match them using regex patterns OR identify which AWS resources match given patterns
- Visual, engaging, with the same polish as the Hangman game (particle effects, sound, achievements)
- Multiple difficulty levels and categories

## Style Reference
- See existing game at: `_posts/2025-10-19-browser-games-with-claude.md`
- Same aesthetic: Canvas particle effects, Web Audio API sounds, dark mode, achievements, localStorage stats
- Vanilla JS, no dependencies, embedded in blog post
- antfarm.systems vibe: technically solid with irreverent commentary
